## Recommendations

### 1. Cost Optimization Strategies:

- Consider alternative providers for expensive services

### 2. Risk Mitigation:

- Prepare alternative implementations for critical APIs

### 3. Volume-Based Planning:
- Negotiate enterprise pricing with providers at 10K+ users
- Consider direct integrations to reduce per-transaction costs
- Implement usage-based billing to pass costs to users
