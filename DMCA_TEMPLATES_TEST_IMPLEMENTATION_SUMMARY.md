- **`EnhancedTemplateEditor.test.tsx`**: 600+ lines covering editor functionality, undo/redo, variable management, live preview, and auto-save

### 2. Integration Tests  
- **`TemplateIntegration.test.tsx`**: 400+ lines testing complete template lifecycle, API integration, error handling, search/filter integration, and data flow validation

### 3. Performance & Accessibility Tests
