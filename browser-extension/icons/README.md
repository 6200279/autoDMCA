## Creating Icons

To create the icons for production use:

1. Design a base 512x512 icon with:
   - Shield or protection symbol
   - Clean, modern design
   - Good contrast for visibility
   - Brand colors (#4CAF50, #2196F3)

2. Export to required sizes:
   - Use image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
   - Maintain crisp edges at all sizes
   - Save as PNG with transparency

3. Place files in this directory with exact naming:
   - icon-16.png
   - icon-32.png  
   - icon-48.png
   - icon-128.png

## Current Status

**Placeholder icons needed** - Replace these with actual designed icons before production deployment.
